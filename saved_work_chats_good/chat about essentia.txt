 Project Context
Youâ€™re building the AI Music Assistant as a plugin-based system that:

Analyzes WAV and MIDI files

Summarizes, transforms, and generates music

Uses Python plugins registered automatically (@register_plugin)

Lives inside a clean folder structure (src/, input_files/, reports/)

ðŸ§° Problem You Faced
You were trying to install Essentia, a powerful C++ audio analysis library, using pip on Windows (inside Conda). You ran into this:

csharp
Copy code
'rm' is not recognized... %1 is not a valid Win32 application
Which is caused by:

Essentia expecting Linux tools (rm, make, cmake, Boost)

No Windows-compatible pip/conda builds

Git LFS + compiler toolchain issues

âœ… Solution: Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
We walked through a simple beginner-friendly way to:

Install WSL using:

powershell
Copy code
wsl --install
Reboot the system when prompted

Let Ubuntu finish installing

Plan to install essentia inside Ubuntu after reboot

This lets you:

Run Linux-only tools like Essentia from Windows

Trigger plugins using subprocess.run(["wsl", ...])

Keep your Python project on Windows with full access to audio features via JSON output

ðŸ“¦ What Youâ€™ll Be Able to Do (Once in Ubuntu)
Install Essentia cleanly using:

bash
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential python3-pip git cmake libfftw3-dev libeigen3-dev
pip install essentia
Then test:

bash
Copy code
python3 -c "import essentia; print(essentia.__version__)"
Youâ€™ll be able to:

Run essentia_streaming_extractor_music from Windows

Grab powerful audio feature JSON files

Plug it into your assistant with no errors or OS conflicts

ðŸ”œ Next Step
After your reboot and Ubuntu login, say:
ðŸ‘‰ "Iâ€™m in Ubuntu"

And Iâ€™ll guide you through the 3-line Essentia install. Want me to auto-generate the essentia_bridge.py plugin next too?
